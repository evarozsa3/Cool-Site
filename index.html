      <strong>Ice ice baby</strong>
      Ice ice baby
      All right stop
      Collaborate and listen
      Ice is back with my brand new invention
      Something grabs a hold of me tightly
      Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
      Will it ever stop?
      Yo, I don't know
      Turn off the lights and I'll glow
      To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
      Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      <strong>Dance</strong>
      Go rush the speaker that booms
      I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
      Deadly, when I play a dope melody
      Anything less than the best is a felony
      Love it or leave it
      You better gain way
      You better hit bull's eye
      The kid don't play
      If there was a problem
      Yo, I'll solve it
      Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">Ice ice baby Vanilla,
      Ice ice baby Vanilla,
      Ice ice baby Vanilla,
      Ice ice baby Vanilla,</p>
